📦 setup.py (for humans)
=======================

这个代码库的存在是为了提供一个 [示例 setup.py] 文件，可用于启动您的下一个 Python 项目。它包括一些高级模式和最佳实践，适用于 `setup.py`，以及一些已注释掉的有用的功能。

> This repo exists to provide [an example setup.py] file, that can be used to bootstrap your next Python project. It includes some advanced patterns and best practices for `setup.py`, as well as some commented–out nice–to–haves.

例如，这个 `setup.py` 提供了一个 `$ python setup.py upload` 命令，它创建了一个 *universal wheel*（和 *sdist*），并使用 [Twine] 将您的包上传到 [PyPi]，而无需烦人的 `setup.cfg` 文件。它还自动创建/上传一个新的 git 标签。

> For example, this `setup.py` provides a `$ python setup.py upload` command, which creates a *universal wheel* (and *sdist*) and uploads your package to [PyPi] using [Twine], without the need for an annoying `setup.cfg` file. It also creates/uploads a new git tag, automatically.

简而言之，当您刚开始接触 `setup.py` 文件时，可能会感到令人生畏 — 即使 Guido 也曾听到过“每个人都在模仿别人的做法”。这是真的 — 所以，我希望这个代码库是最好的复制粘贴来源 :)

> In short, `setup.py` files can be daunting to approach, when first starting out — even Guido has been heard saying, "everyone cargo cults thems". It's true — so, I want this repo to be the best place to copy–paste from :)
